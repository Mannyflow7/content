#### Integrations
##### Recorded Future v2
- Added the *fetchStatuses* integration parameter to allow users to specify which Recorded Future alert statuses to include in the fetch (default is 'no-action')
- Added the *updateStatus* integration parameter to allow users to specify whether a Recorded Future alert should have it's status updated once fetched by the integration (default is True)
- Fixed an issue where the integration would repeatedly fetch the same alerts due to incorrectly setting the last fetch time
