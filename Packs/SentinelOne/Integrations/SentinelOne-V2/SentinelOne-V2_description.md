You can use an API token or username/password to authenticate.
If you fill in both the API key will be used.

1. To get your API token, log in to your SentinelOne console.
2. Click your user name in the upper-right corner, and select *My User*.
3. Click the *Generate* link, located near the *API Token* field.
4. Save your API token in a safe place because you will not be able to access it anymore.
